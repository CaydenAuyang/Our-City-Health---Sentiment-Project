# Project Objective
You are helping build “Our City Health” — an interactive civic wellbeing dashboard.
Pipeline: scrape (news + Reddit) → tag cities → select docs fairly → LLM score 12 dimensions → JSON outputs → HTML dashboards.

# Codebase Map (authoritative)
- Automation-Project/conclusive_scraper_and_analysis.py: main pipeline (CLI flags documented in README).
- Automation-Project/map.html: globe UI (3D with per-run/cumulative stats).
- Automation-Project/city_health_dashboard_MASSIVE.html: dashboard UI (scores, issues, citations).
- Automation-Project/data/: outputs (data/latest/*) and sqlite cache (visited.sqlite).
- basic_*.py: small, earlier scrapers (NYT, Reddit).
- README.md: run instructions + structure.

# Non-negotiables
- Maintain fairness: balanced per-city doc cap (--city_docs).
- Ensure transparency: preserve full citations in outputs and UI.
- Keep scraping respectful (timeouts, concurrency, retries as coded).
- JSON schema must remain strict and deterministic for downstream UI.

# When asked to change the scoring
- Do NOT remove fairness or transparency.
- Propose a flag-gated change (default OFF) with clear schema notes.

# Style
- Clear, commented Python; small, testable functions where reasonable.
- Keep UI changes to HTML/JS minimalistic, accessible, and performant.

# Preferred Commands
- Fast sample run:
  python3 Automation-Project/conclusive_scraper_and_analysis.py --num_cities 20 --per_source_limit 120 --reddit_pages 3 --reddit_comments 50 --city_docs 200 --out data/latest
- Full run (heavy):
  python3 Automation-Project/conclusive_scraper_and_analysis.py --cities_link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities" --num_cities 100 --per_source_limit 500 --reddit_pages 10 --reddit_comments 100 --city_docs 500 --out data/latest

# Files to Read First
README.md
Automation-Project/conclusive_scraper_and_analysis.py
Automation-Project/city_health_dashboard_MASSIVE.html
Automation-Project/map.html

# Avoid Using As Primary Context (unless asked)
- Large JSON in data/latest/*
- SQLite cache files
