# Our City Health
**Interactive civic wellbeing dashboard â€” [ourcityhealth.com](https://ourcityhealth.com)**

We turn a continuously updated corpus of public articles and community discussions into a comparable **Civic Health Pulse** for cities worldwide. Using AI and city-tuned sentiment analysis, we score how communities feel about core signals (affordability, services, safety, opportunity, culture), with clickable sources and transparent methods.
